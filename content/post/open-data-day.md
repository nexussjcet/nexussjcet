Contribution to Wikipedia and Open Street Maps (OSM) Mapping Party at SJCET, Palai  

## Contributing to FOSS 
Many of us are unsure of how we can start contributing to open source, we assume it would require us to have development knowledge and would have to do something similar to packaging Linux software.  
But there are various other means that require almost no coding skills and just require our general knowledge and understanding, writting skills, or organizational capabilities. One such means of contribution is joining OSM mapping parties, or Mapathons, and map the areas around you, which includes mapping routes, specifying the type of building, roads, and other various features of the various entities on the map.
