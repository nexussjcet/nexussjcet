Good design is as little design as possible.
## Smart choices that make sense in the long run.

We had multiple iterations for our official website before this. They were either too complex or too simple. As time went by we realized ease of use and simplicity is what works in the long run.

To quote the suckless manifest:    "Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks."

- The Suckless Philosophy
- The Best Motherfucking Website
- A StackExchange Question
- The Best Code is No Code At All by Jeff Atwood
- The Duct Tape Programmer
