Good design is as little design as possible.
## Smart choices that make sense in the long run.

We had multiple iterations for our official website before this. They were either too complex or too simple. As time went by we realized ease of use and simplicity is what works in the long run. Why use a front-end framework when all you need is a way to show some text and images on a screen? Why use large databases when it doesn't really make any difference for your use case. Why pull out the swiss knife when all you need is a toothpick? Less is more. 

## The Spirit of the Free Software Movement
Free SOftware is always about taking back user freedom. It's always ideal for a piece of software to aim to be easy to understand and extend for their users. Simplicity makes it easier for people to understand and contribute to projects and moreover makes it easier to maintain. In this perspective too it makes sense for us to make this website as simple to use and extend, not just by us but by those who come after us too.

## Better Code = Better World
 I've also come to the realization that number of lines of code doesn't mean anything. As in any language it's always better to use just the right amount of words to express your thoughts anything more is a wastage of resources. What's really important is the quality of code. To quote the suckless manifest: "Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks."


There are a few websites and projects that has inspired me to take this step. A few of them have been listed below. They talk in detail regarding things I've mentioned above :).
- The Suckless Philosophy
- The Best Motherfucking Website
- A StackExchange Question
- The Best Code is No Code At All by Jeff Atwood
- The Duct Tape Programmer
