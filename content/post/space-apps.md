Organising and hosting the first ever NASA Space Apps Challenge in Kerala is one of the highlights of my college life. It was around august when my co-organizer Abraham Raji approached me with the idea of hosting a hackathon. At that point I had only heard vaguely about this. Growing up fascinated about space and its vast possibilities I had zero doubts associating my name with a hackathon organized by NASA.

NASA Space Apps Challenge is an international hackathon for coders, scientists, designers, storytellers, makers, builders, technologists and pretty much anyone interested, all around the globe. I soon connected with the national organizers, SUMVN, who were a team of really interesting people from Telangana. I believe that SJCET was really fortunate to host Kerala’s first College ever to host the challenge.

We started with the preparations for the pre-hackathon with the help of NEXUS and SJCET Bootcamp. We had a vibrant team to make sure everything was planned and executed to perfection. The hackathon lasted for 2 days with participants from all over the state. All contestants were excited to do their part to bring solutions to help our home planet. Most teams started brainstorming almost immediately. There was an introductory session followed by mentoring with the national organizers. After almost twelve-fourteen hours of brainstorming and hard-work the participants sure needed some cheering up. We had ice-breaking sessions filled with fun and music. The next morning things started to pace up. Teams had their initial presentations and pitching followed by some critics from the mentors by noon all participants were ready for their final pitching. The top four teams selected have the opportunity to compete at the national hackathon to get a chance to visit the NASA faculty in the USA and for the final challenge. It’s truly an exhilarating feeling when you see the happy faces of the top performers and know that the event was a success. This would not have been possible without the help of our dear volunteers from NEXUS and Bootcamp and our backbone Sarju sir. As an appreciation for our efforts our college received an award from the national organizers for being the host with the best hospitality and both me and Abraham received the 'Stellar Leads' award. If I had a chance to relieve this experience again I’ll click that switch in a jiffy.
