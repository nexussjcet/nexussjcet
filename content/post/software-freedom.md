## What is software freedom?
As most should have already seen at the landing page of our website, software freedom entails 4 freedoms to a particular user, These are:  
* The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and modify it
* The freedom to redistribute copies.
* The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others. 

According to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), Software freedom is only complete when no restrictions are imposed on how these freedoms are exercised. Specifically, users and programmers can exercise these freedoms non-commercially or commercially. Licenses that grant these freedoms for noncommercial activities but prohibit them for commercial activities are considered non-free. 

## Purpose
It is quite an important day for those of us who practice free and open source development to have ability to use the programs we own without any restrictions, legally. Without this freedom we are just under the shackles of Tech giants abusing their power and imposing their vision onto masses.

Therefore to celebrate this day and to educate the students at our college we had [Abraham Raji](https://abrahamraji.in) talk about the beginning of Free Software Movement through the works of Richard Stallman the impact it has on the software development world today.
