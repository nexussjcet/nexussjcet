## Organizing the pre-FYPM qualifiers 
Our team, being enthusiastic about Open source, we wised to organise an event that in association with a prominent open source development  entity, and thus we came across the FYPM organised by ICFOSS. We held the qualifier rounds at our college and had participants coming in from different colleges from Kottayam district. 

## Attending FYPM 
Being the organisers of Pre-FYPM qualifiers I and [Abraham Raji](https://abrahamraji.in) were invited to attend the main event at which was being held at Uday Samudra Resort in Kovalam, Trivandrum. We attended the event with two other students from our college who had qualified for the main event. and were able to meet a lot of prominent figures at the venue, and of course we can't forget the mouth-watering buffet we feasted on during our stay there as well as the rocking DJ party we had on the last night of the event. 

It was a wonderful event all in all and we were able to learn a lot through the speakers.
