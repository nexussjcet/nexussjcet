## Organizing the pre-FYPM qualifiers 
Our team, being enthusiastic about Open source, we wanted to organise an event that in association with a prominent FOSS entity, and thus we came across the FYPM organised by ICFOSS. We held the Pre-FYPM Meetup at our college and had participants coming in from different colleges from Kottayam and Idukki districts. 

## Attending FYPM 
Being the organisers of Pre-FYPM qualifiers [Abraham Raji](https://abrahamraji.in) and I were invited to attend the main event at which was being held at Uday Samudra Resort in Kovalam, Trivandrum. We attended the event with two other students from our college who had qualified for the main event and were able to meet a lot of prominent figures at the venue, It was a wonderful event all in all and we were able to learn a lot through the speakers. Of course we can't forget the mouth-watering buffet we feasted on during our stay there as well as the rocking DJ party we had on the last night of the event which is the beauty of events organised by Open source communities.
